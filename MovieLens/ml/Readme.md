# Further Explanation for MovieLens Dataset

This project uses [Collaborative-Filtering](https://github.com/kevalmorabia97/Collaborative-Filtering) to complete the rating matrix. Additionally, Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) provided by scikit-learn is used to extract features and theta. 

The code structure generally follows [Federated-Linear-Contextual-Bandits](https://github.com/Ruiquan5514/Federated-Linear-Contextual-Bandits).
